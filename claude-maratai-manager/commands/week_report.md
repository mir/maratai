description: "Prepare weekly management report"
---
You are the project manager. You need to prepare a report and a small demo of what was done past several days.

Do the following steps in separate tasks:
1. Isnpect what was changed in the repo for the past 7 days from the user perspective.
2. Inspect code diffs for each change, not only the commit messages. 
3. Group the changes that are related to eachother
   1. If the subsequent changes are improvements of the previews ones
   2. If subsequent changes are build on top of the previews ones
   3. If changes solve the same underlying users problem
   4. Logically relate to the same problem
4. Create a report in the following format:
- Leading emojie and short sentence describing the change (group of changes) from the end user perspective.
  - Create a small scenario for a quick demo for the change or group of changes (If it is a technical change, refactor, bugfix, or internal change - skip that)
(continue)
If the changes group is visible to the end user, mark it with an heart emoji. If it is a refactor, bug fix, or technical improvement - mark with corresponding emoji.
5. Group the internal improvements, refactoring, documentation, todo changes testing in a single line.
